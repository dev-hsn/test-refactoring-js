# Comments / Advices

First thank you all for giving me this opportunity to work on this project, I found it very challenging on the first time.

The code was very messy and very complicated to understand the logic of every module.

# Explanation

To refactor this project, I had to follow a design pattern, and for this I choose the MVC, because it's very suited to this project with routing and so on, and the MVC make things easy to understand, to manipulate and to test.

I started by working on the views, I had to separate the views from the static assets, Then I worked on the templates it self to follow the BEM methodology so the css become easy to manage when the apps grow bigger and also I used some HTML5 tags for SEO and the title and the description of the page...

I didn't used SASS for this project because it's very light and there's no need for it unless if the apps will be more complex.

Then I separated the middleware from the routes.

Then the controllers from the routes.

In the last step I wrapped every application's files in the app folder so it can be easy to separate it from the development files

And finally I structured the gulp files in a folder to make it clear to understand.

We can add more futures for this project, it depends on your need.

So thanks again for your review, I hope you like it :)

Best regards,
Hassane
